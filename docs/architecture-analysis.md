# Architecture Analysis: Go Design Principle Violations

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive analysis of the current Go codebase architecture and identifies critical violations of Go design principles. The main architectural issue is the **monolithic service registration** in `internal/services.go` that violates separation of concerns and creates tight coupling between architectural layers.

## Current Architecture Problems

### 1. **Critical Issue: Monolithic Service Container** 

**File:** `internal/services.go`

**Problem:** The `Services` struct mixes multiple architectural layers in a single registration container:

```go
type Services struct {
    // Repositories (Data Layer)
    MemoryRepo domain.MemoryRepository
    UserRepo   domain.UserRepository

    // Use cases (Business Layer) 
    MemoryUsecase usecase.MemoryUsecase
    UserUsecase   usecase.UserUsecase

    // Handlers (Presentation Layer)
    MemoryHandler *handlers.MemoryHandler
    UserHandler   *handlers.UserHandler
}
```

**Violations:**
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: One struct handling multiple concerns
- **Separation of Concerns**: Business, data, and presentation layers mixed
- **Package Coupling**: Forces tight coupling between all layers
- **Go Package Philosophy**: Violates Go's preference for focused, single-purpose packages

### 2. **Dependency Direction Violations**

**Problem:** The current architecture forces incorrect dependency directions:

```
main.go → internal/services.go → {domain, usecase, repository, handlers}
```

**Issues:**
- The `internal` package becomes a central orchestrator (anti-pattern in Go)
- All layers are coupled through a single service container
- Violates the Dependency Inversion Principle
- Makes testing individual layers difficult

### 3. **Package Organization Problems**

#### 3.1 **Domain Layer Pollution**
**File:** `internal/domain/user.go`

**Problems:**
- Mixes core domain entities with request/response DTOs
- Database tags (`db:"field"`) in domain entities violate clean architecture
- JSON tags in domain entities couple business logic to serialization

```go
type User struct {
    ID        uuid.UUID    `json:"id" db:"id"`  // ← Violates domain purity
    Username  string       `json:"username" db:"username"`
    // ...
}
```

#### 3.2 **Usecase Layer Issues**
**File:** `internal/usecase/user_usecase.go`

**Problems:**
- Interfaces defined in implementation packages (should be in domain)
- Direct dependency on both user and memory repositories in user usecase
- Validation logic mixed with business logic

```go
type UserUsecase interface {  // ← Should be in domain package
    CreateUser(req *domain.UserCreateRequest) (*domain.User, error)
    // ...
}

type userUsecase struct {
    userRepo   domain.UserRepository
    memoryRepo domain.MemoryRepository  // ← Questionable cross-domain dependency
}
```

#### 3.3 **Repository Layer Issues**
**File:** `internal/repository/user_repository.go`

**Problems:**
- Heavy GORM coupling in domain boundary
- Complex domain-to-model conversions in repository layer
- Missing abstraction over database specifics

### 4. **Interface Design Violations**

#### 4.1 **Interface Placement**
- Interfaces defined in implementation packages instead of consumer packages
- Violates Go's "accept interfaces, return structs" principle
- Interfaces not at the right abstraction boundaries

#### 4.2 **Interface Size**
- Large interfaces violate Interface Segregation Principle
- `UserRepository` interface has 11 methods - too broad
- `MemoryRepository` interface has 8 methods - could be segregated

### 5. **Testing and Modularity Issues**

#### 5.1 **Testing Complexity**
- Monolithic service registration makes unit testing difficult
- Mock generation complexity due to tight coupling
- Integration tests required for simple unit test scenarios

#### 5.2 **Modularity Problems**
- Cannot easily swap implementations
- Difficult to extend with new features
- Hard to maintain and debug due to coupling

## Go Design Principle Violations Summary

### 1. **Package Cohesion and Separation of Concerns**
- **Violation**: Mixed concerns in single service container
- **Impact**: Tight coupling, difficult maintenance
- **Go Philosophy**: "A package should have a clear purpose"

### 2. **Interface Segregation**
- **Violation**: Large, monolithic interfaces
- **Impact**: Clients depend on methods they don't use
- **Go Philosophy**: "Keep interfaces small"

### 3. **Dependency Inversion**
- **Violation**: High-level modules depend on low-level modules through service container
- **Impact**: Reduced flexibility and testability
- **Go Philosophy**: "Accept interfaces, return structs"

### 4. **Single Responsibility**
- **Violation**: Multiple responsibilities in service container and domain entities
- **Impact**: Difficult to change and test
- **Go Philosophy**: "Do one thing well"

### 5. **Import Cycles and Package Dependencies**
- **Violation**: Complex dependency graph through central service container
- **Impact**: Potential for import cycles, reduced modularity
- **Go Philosophy**: "Clear dependency directions"

## Impact Assessment

### **High Impact Issues:**
1. **Monolithic Service Container** - Affects entire application architecture
2. **Domain Layer Pollution** - Violates core architectural principles
3. **Interface Misplacement** - Makes testing and mocking difficult

### **Medium Impact Issues:**
1. **Dependency Direction Problems** - Reduces flexibility
2. **Large Interfaces** - Makes implementation and testing harder

### **Low Impact Issues:**
1. **Package Naming Inconsistencies** - Minor but affects readability
2. **Error Handling Patterns** - Could be more Go-idiomatic

## Recommendations Summary

1. **Eliminate Service Container**: Replace with proper dependency injection
2. **Restructure Package Organization**: Align with Go project layout standards  
3. **Clean Domain Layer**: Remove infrastructure concerns from domain entities
4. **Segregate Interfaces**: Create smaller, focused interfaces
5. **Fix Dependency Directions**: Implement proper dependency inversion
6. **Improve Testing Architecture**: Enable true unit testing

The current architecture, while functional, significantly deviates from Go best practices and will become increasingly difficult to maintain and extend as the codebase grows.
